Digital Voice files are transmitted to us via secure bespoke email, through the secure upload facility, or through VPN connection to your voice file handling software. We can be set up as a typist within your voice file handling software. We assign a team of professional typists to type and quality check your documents. Your files will then have a complete second check before being returning to you as a perfect document ready for printing on your letterhead or filing.<br />
<br />
All your typing is done by permanent Keystroke Pro staff working from our secure offices on our I.T. equipment. We do not outsource your work to homeworkers or third parties.<br />

<br />
A 250 strong Law firm in London with 3 offices was keen to use an outsourced typing facility to help control its erratic peaks of work flow and endless delays in typing brought about by the loss of several of their more reliable and productive support staff. They were also keen to take the opportunity to investigate potential cost savings. A firm wide roll-out of digital dictation had just been successfully completed.<br />
<br />
Following a meeting with KeyStroke Pro it was agreed that a free trial would be run.<br />
<br />
After just one week of running a trial of KeyStroke Pro's typing service they were so impressed with turnaround, quality and the pending cost savings that they signed up for the service. Starting with the processing of Attendance Notes they rapidly expanded the work to include all other legal typing.<br />
<br />
Feedback from all levels indicates that the project has been a huge success and the relationship will continue to grow and be long and meaningful. Support staff have more time available to concentrate on urgent issues, are being promoted to Paralegals and are more productive. Fee earners are enjoying reduced error rates, are saving themselves valuable time checking and proof reading documents and have quicker turn around time of their<br />
documents leading to satisfied clients and quicker and more accurate billing. They have not had to concern themselves with taking on temporary staff for over 12 months and have no issues coping with natural wastage of staff, holidays or absenteeism brought about through illness.<br />
<br />
Savings in the last year have reportedly amounted to in excess of £180,000. The company has been able to halve the number of extra support staff they originally planned to employ; savings are forecasted to more than double in the next 12 months.<br />
<br />
We regularly type in excess of 100 hours of dictation per month for this client and receive several referrals a year from them.

However, many more companies and services are impacted,  including those who provide services or supplies to health service providers or to patients under the direction  of providers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutside technology vendors, transcription providers, accountants, attorneys and anyone else who may come in  to contact with patient information in the course of normal business dealings is also affected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHIPAA implementation work has concentrated on defining standard transactions for use by providers and  third-party payers, and creating standard definitions for health care providers, employers, health plans and  individuals to use in creating patient record information. Code sets have been created to define standard<br />\r\nmedical terms, diagnosis codes, diseases, injuries, etc. Medical procedure codes have also been defined for  actions taken to prevent, diagnose, treat or manage diseases, injuries and impairments, as well as for  medications, equipment, supplies and other items prescribed for treatment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn affected organization must implement measures, policies and procedures to assure the security of any  information systems that contain individually identifiable patient health information. These would be coordinated  and integrated with other system configuration management practices in order to assure system<br />\r\nintegrity when changes to system hardware or software are made. Any software purchased as a package from  an outside vendor must also be compliant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, affected parties must provide a contingency plan that provides for responding to information  system emergencies, including periodic backing up of data, having and testing facilities for continuing  operations in the event of an emergency, and developing effective disaster recovery procedures. Computer<br />\r\ncontrols and security measures should be documented in the same manner as other policies and procedures.  Each organization is also required to have a policy on workstation use. These documented instructions and  procedures should delineate the proper functions to be performed and the manner in which those functions are  to be performed (e.g., logging off before leaving a terminal unattended). Restrictions must be put in place to  prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing information stored on the entity's computers.  Facilities that use communications networks are required to protect messages containing health information  when they transmit them electronically to prevent them from being intercepted and read by parties other than  the intended recipient. They must also protect their information systems from intruders trying to access  information from external communication points. This typically means that some form of encryption must be  used to protect this information. As well, there needs to be documented policies and security features for the  use of fax, e-mail, Internet, remote dictation and transcription services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe HHS Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcement of the HIPAA Privacy Regulations.

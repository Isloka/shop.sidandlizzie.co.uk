Keystroke Pro's Financial Division is tasked with transcribing Investor Relation Conferences and Corporate Conferences.<br />
<br />
Reading a transcript of a Corporate Conference rather than attending them or listening to web casts saves real time. You need to know that the transcript is accurate and is available in a timely fashion to ensure that you are kept up to date with market intelligence.<br />
